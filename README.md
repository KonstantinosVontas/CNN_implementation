# CNN_implementation


Training of a Convolutional Neural Network in order to predict the estimation of droplet/bubbles curvatures.

This is a project as part of the secondment that I conducted at ETH Zurich.
In this repo a CNN is trained (after scaling the data and using DataLoader to enter then into the network).
Different metrics have been used (e.g. loss function over each epoch, relative error and abolute error evolution over each epoch and more)
to evaluate the network.
